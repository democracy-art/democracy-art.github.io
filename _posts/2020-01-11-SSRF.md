### Introduction to SSRF
 [SSRF](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Server_Side_Request_Forgery).
* According to OWASP, a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack, 
the attacker can abuse functionality on the server to read or update 
internal resources. 
* The good thing about SSRF is that you cant chain it / a lot of possible attack vectors.
* SSRF to Ports Scan, SSRF to Identify Internal Web Services, SSRF to Local File Read, SSRF to Data Leakage, etc.
* Leveraging port smuggling


### Two types of SSRF: External SSRF and Internal SSRF
#### External SSRF
* Making outbound connections to a server you control
* Making a pingback to a provided external URL
* In some cases it allows you  to get an internal IP or sensitive data
* parses the content of a parameter using an external URL for example
http://example.com/check?url=https://google.com
* Doesn't necessarily prove an exploitable SSRF scenario
* In some case provide feedback through error or by design

#### Internal SSRF
* Hitting internal services like grabbing metadata from an ASW host,
discover internal hosts, and perform banner grabs from services.
* Traverse internal networks & access internal administrative panels, routers, etc.
* Scenario where forged requests can be routed internally
example.com/lookup?url=localhost
* Run port scans on internal IPs
* Debug enpoints example.com/lookup?url=localhost/server-status
